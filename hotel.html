          <p>Hotel Management System is written in Python. This is a simple console based system which is very easy to understand and use. Talking about the system, it contains all the basic functions which include entering customer’s data, calculating room rent, restaurant bill, laundry bill, game bill, and total cost. In this mini project, there is no such login system. This means user can use all those available features easily without any restriction. It is too easy to use, user can check the total cost of staying in the hotel easily with each and every detail.</p>
          <p>Talking about the features of this Hotel Management System, at first, the user has to enter data. It includes the name of the user, address, check-in, and check-out dates. The user can calculate room rents. Inside this section, there are total four types of room with different prices. After selecting the room type, the system asks to enter the number of nights spent in order to calculate room rent.</p>
          <p>This simple system also contains other functions such as calculating restaurant, laundry and game bill. When the user selects to calculate restaurant bill, the system displays a small menu. From there the user has to select foods and then it displays the total restaurant bill. The other remaining features; calculating laundry and game bill also follows the same procedure as of calculating restaurant bill.</p>
