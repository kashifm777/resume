          <p>Computers have become a way of life for todays high society. Many aspects of modern life that we have come to accept as common place would not be possible if there were no computers. Today computers are use extensively in many areas of  business, industry, science, education etc.</p>

          <p>Cyber Cafe Management System is a software package which can be used in cyber cafes for managing the clients'' computer efficiently. Nowadays cyber terrorism, which is mainly undergone through internet cafes, need to be tackled properly. Thereby, it is indeed necessary to store the valid information of the user who comes for internet access. The system being used, the time at which the user logs in and logs out should be recorded systematically.</p>

          <p>In this project an attempt is made to design a computer system for the cyber cafe that makes the management of recording user details, internet usage and billing much easier. The objective of this software is to maintain the details of users, cabins and login history. Through this system we provide facility of prepaid and postpaid accounts respectively for account users and Walkthrough users. It has the features like adding, viewing, editing of user details, cabin details, recharge option for prepaid users, billing, tariff settings,etc.</p>

          <p>The software powered by PHP assures clear and efficient services to the agency. This easy-to-operate system helps to access and modify user details, provides efficient billing facility. The software is designed to provide reliable and error free information. The database is driven by MySQL thus providing portability. Anyone having an account with the system can have access to internet by logging into the client machine using a given username and password. Account users can login only if they have sufficient balance in their account. Otherwise they will have to recharge their account using the recharging facility at the administrator side. To ensure enhanced security user account creation, editing, etc. are available only at the administrator side.</p>
